🔌 Bit Manipulation Utilities in Embedded C

This repository contains small, efficient C programs for working with bit-level operations on microcontroller-style registers (uint8_t, uint16_t, etc).
These utilities are commonly used in embedded firmware, driver development, and hardware register manipulation.
